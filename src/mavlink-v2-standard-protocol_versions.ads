--  Version and capability of protocol version. This message can be requested
--  with MAV_CMD_REQUEST_MESSAGE and is used as part of the handshaking to
--  establish which MAVLink version should be used on the network. Every node
--  should respond to a request for PROTOCOL_VERSION to enable the
--  handshaking. Library implementers should consider adding this into the
--  default decoding state machine to allow the protocol core to respond
--  directly.
